20213684,device,DNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR,"Quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) was used to confirm expression changes observed in the microarray analysis. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol procedure. First strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA (5 mg) using Superscript III cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA preparations were then diluted and used in reactions with SYBER green QPCR master mix. Reactions were amplified using an ABI Prism 7300 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each cDNA sample was assayed in triplicate using the primer sequences listed in Table III and b-actin as a control. Thermal cycle conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 958C for 600 s, followed by 40 cycles of 958C for 15 s, 608C for 60 s. Fluorescence was measured at the beginning of each annealing/extension step. To check specificity of each primer the predicted Amplicon melting temperature was confirmed via dissociation curve analysis. PCR products were denatured and gradually re-annealed. Amplicon size was also determined by electrophoresis on an agarose gel (2% w/v). Relative expression changes in genes were then calculated using the DDC t quantification method. In some instances the DDC t value was averaged and normalized for the FLT group compared to the AEM group"

21169425,organism,Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1,"Bacterial strain and growth media. A derivative of the wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 (ATCC 15692), which contained a gentamicin resistance cassette in the attB site, was used for the spaceflight experiment. The gentamicin-resistant strain was constructed through homologous recombination as described previously (38). P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown in LB medium containing 25 g/ml gentamicin in the spaceflight hardware (see below) to avoid growth of any contaminants. The bacterial inoculum (1.5 \u03eb 10 8 CFU/ml) in the spaceflight hardware was suspended in 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen) and re-mained viable but static (not growing) during launch and until 9 days into the flight. After this time, growth was initiated by the addition of LB as described below. Cells were fixed in flight using the RNA and protein fixative RNA Later II (Ambion). At 2.5 h after landing of the space shuttle at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), samples were recovered and subsequently used for whole-genome transcriptional microarray and proteomic analyses. In each case, the flight culture samples were compared with synchronous culture samples grown under identical conditions on the ground at KSC using coordinated activation and termination times (by means of real-time communications with the shuttle astronauts) in an insulated room that maintained temperature and humidity levels identical to those on the shuttle (orbital environment simulator). Experimental setup adopted for spaceflight culturing. Growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was initiated in flight, and cells were cultured in space and on the ground in specialized hardware termed the fluid-processing apparatus (FPA) as described previously (46, 47) (Fig. 1). Briefly, FPAs are glass barrels, containing a bevel on the side, in which rubber stoppers are inserted for compartmentalization. The bottom stopper contained a gas exchange membrane. Glass barrels and rubber stoppers were coated with a silicone lubricant (Sigmacote; Sigma) and autoclaved separately before assembly. The subsequent insertion of rubber stoppers into the FPAs resulted in the creation of three separate compartments which contained, from top to bottom, (i) RNA Later II fixative (2.5 ml), (ii) bacteria suspended in PBS (0.5 ml), and (iii) LB culture medium (2 ml). The last compartment was created at the level of the bevel. Each FPA was loaded into a lexan sheet that contained a gas-permeable membrane at the bottom, and eight FPAs were subsequently loaded into larger containers, termed group activation packs (GAPs). This experimental setup created a triple level of containment for crew safety. At specific time points in flight, an astronaut manually inserted a hand crank into the end of the GAP and turned it, which pushed down on a pressure plate underneath, resulting in a plunging action on the rubber stoppers of each FPA. This plunging action, which allowed for mixing of fluids between different compartments through the bevel, was performed twice in flight. The first plunging action, referred to as activation, served to add LB growth medium to the cells, and the second (following a 25-h growth period) added fixative to preserve samples for gene expression analysis. All phases of the experiment on orbit were conducted at ambient temperature (23\u00b0C). Shuttle landing occurred at approximately 58 h postfixation. RNA extraction, labeling, and Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. Total cellular RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Conversion to fluorescently labeled cDNA, hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip arrays, and image acquisition were performed as previously described (29). Raw Affymetrix data were normalized and processed utilizing tools identical to those for the study of P. aeruginosa PAO1 under microgravity analogue conditions (13). The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used for multiple-testing correction (7). Only fold change ratios with P values below 0.05 (corrected for multiple testing) were considered statistically significant. Microarray analysis was performed on all three biological replicates. Protein identification analysis. Proteins from spaceflight and ground cell lysates were precipitated with acetone and subjected to multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) analysis using the tandem mass spectrometry (MS)-dual nano-liquid chromatography technique (11,37). Tandem mass spectra of peptides were analyzed with TurboSEQUEST version 3.1 (18) and XTandem ( 14) software. Data were further processed and organized using the Scaffold program. A probability threshold of 90% was adopted, and only proteins present in at least two biological replicates were considered expressed. Spectra were also assessed for good quality based on TurboSEQUEST correlation and DeltaCorrelation scores as previously described (11). Biostatistics. To calculate the overlap of up-and downregulated genes between P. aeruginosa and S. Typhimurium under spaceflight and simulated microgravity culture conditions, homology was determined using the BLAST software (blastp) (1). Genes in different organisms were defined as orthologues when they fulfilled the following criteria: (i) a cutoff on the BLAST E value of 1e\u03ea10, (ii) a minimal alignment coverage of 80% of the shortest DNA or protein sequence, (iii) a minimal sequence identity of 35%, and (iv) appearance as each other's reciprocal best BLAST hit. The statistical significance of the number of overlapping genes between different species and conditions was determined using the hypergeometric distribution method (20).

22296880,organism,Drosophila melanogaster,"levitation magnet and experimental arrangement: The superconducting magnet used to levitate the flies has a 5-cm diameter vertical bore, which is temperature-regulated by forced air flow through the bore (Additional file 1, Figure S1). The magnetic field is strongest at the centre of the bore. The force on diamagnetic material in the magnetic field is proportional to the product of the field strength, measured in Tesla (T), and the field gradient, measured in Tm -1 . The expression for the effective gravity (g*) as a function of magnetic field is given in Additional file 1 [28]. The field gradient is zero at the centre of the bore, and rises to a maximum 85 mm above and below the centre. When the field at the centre of the solenoid is 16.5 T, the diamagnetic force on a sample of liquid water placed approximately 80 mm above the centre is sufficient to balance the force of gravity, so that the water levitates as a freely-suspended droplet. At the levitation point, the effective gravity acting on the liquid is zero. The weight of the same sample of water placed approximately 80 mm below the centre of the solenoid is twice that outside the magnet; in this sense, the effective gravity acting on the water is twice Earth\'s gravity (2 g). By performing experiments simultaneously at 0 g*, 1 g* and 2 g* and in the control outside the magnet (1 g), we were able to distinguish unambiguously between the effects on the flies of altering their net effective weight, and any other effects of the high magnetic field.\nbiological experiment: To maximise the output of our magnet experimental time we performed three experiments under different environmental conditions inside the magnet, which, for convenience, we refer to by the duration of the experiment (\'short-term\', \'medium-term\', \'long-term\').\n1) ""shortterm"" (1 day) experiment: Virgin females were mated overnight with an excess of young males. Male and female 1-2 day old Oregon R Drosophila melanogaster flies were both exposed to diamagnetic levitation for the following 26 hours at 14°C. During this time, their behaviour was monitored using CCD cameras. After exposure to the magnetic field, the eggs laid inside the magnet were counted and were allowed to hatch in order to monitor the normality of the developmental process of eggs formed during levitation conditions. Both males and females were homogenised separately to study their gene expression profiles by microarray analysis. Our choice of 14°C for the bore temperature was based on preliminary observations indicating that any effects may be amplified by suboptimal growth conditions [21]. 2) ""Medium-term"" (5 day) experiment Pupae (OregonR Drosophila early pupae) collected in Madrid and transported to Nottingham at 14°C were incubated in the magnet for 5 days at 24°C, to analyse the effect on the metamorphosis of the flies replicating the design of a real space experiment performed onboard the ISS [21]. Pupae were allowed to develop into adults inside the magnet to study phenotypic alterations. Recently-hatched flies were separated into males and females and then homogenised in bulk. RNA was extracted and assayed using microarrays to determine the effect of the magnetic field on the expression profile. 3) ""Long-term"" (22 day) experiment The samples (recently-laid OregonR Drosophila eggs) were exposed to the magnetic field for 22 days at 19°C to analyse the effect of the magnetic field and altered effective net weight of the flies on their entire life cycle, from embryo to embryo. The larvae were allowed to pupate in situ and a second generation of flies hatched under these conditions. The second generation imagoes were removed from the magnet and separated into males and females. The males were homogenised to extract the RNA and assayed for gene expression using microarrays. The females were allowed to lay eggs in order to monitor embryo development. 1).\na) diamagnetic levitation of drosophila melanogaster: In the 0 g* tube, we observed flies levitating freely (i.e. not in contact with any surface, or flying) within 1-2 mm of the levitation point of liquid water (Additional file 2, and [27]). This is not unexpected because the flies have a high water content. The net effective weight of a freely levitating fly is zero, in the sense that there is no net (gravitational plus magnetic) force on the fly. Although we observed a few flies levitating freely, the majority remained in contact with the walls, floor and ceiling of the arena enclosed within the tube. The net effective weight of an individual fly on the walls, floor or ceiling depends on its position within the arena (Figure 1C). The effective weight is less than 5% of its weight outside the magnet throughout the arena. We observed that the levitation position of the freely levitating flies varied with their hydration. Dehydrated (dead) flies levitated a few millimetres lower in the magnet than living flies. There was a 1-2 mm difference in levitation position between each of the Drosophila stages. This is consistent with the greater water content of the embryos and early larvae (more than 80% of total mass), reaching the lower level at late pupae (less than 70% of total mass) in comparison with an average 75% of water content in adults [36,37].\nb) delay of development due to the magnetic field: The results of the ""long-term"" (22-day) experiments demonstrated that 1-12 hour old embryos can develop fully, progressing from larvae to pupae to imagoes, both in the RPM and in a strong magnetic field up to 16.5 T. Development in the magnet (0 g*, 1 g* and 2 g*) was slightly but reproducibly delayed by one day, compared to the 1 g control outside the magnet, suggesting that metamorphosis can be delayed in one or more developmental checkpoints. A less evident delay in development was observed in the RPM. Table 2 shows the number of flies that developed from eggs laid in the magnetic field in a ""short term"" (1-day) experiment. After the females were mated, 25 males and 25 females were selected randomly and placed together in the same container in the magnet for 26 hours at 14°C. The eggs laid during those 26 hours were incubated outside the magnet and the flies that developed from the eggs were counted. The results show that exposure to the strong magnetic field during oogenesis and laying caused a large reduction in the number of adult flies that developed from the eggs. The number of flies that developed from eggs laid in the 16.5 T magnetic field (1 g* tube) was just 31% of the number that developed from eggs laid in the 1 g control tube outside the magnet. In the 0 g* and 2 g* tubes, where there was a significant field gradient, the reduction in the number of flies was even greater, being only 5-6% of the number resulting from the 1 g control.\nc) magnetic field affects gene expression: Using Affymetrix whole genome microarrays (Drosophila version 2.0 with 18952 probesets and GeneSpring GX), we analysed the gene expression profile of Drosophila exposed to the magnetic field, and compared the results with Drosophila in a temperature-controlled incubator placed well away from the magnet (1 g). We also compared the results of ""short-term"", ""mediumterm"" and ""long-term"" experiments. In most experiments we performed three replicates, except in a small number of cases (identified by dashes in Table 1) where we were unable to obtain one or more replicates owing to random contamination of the extractions, or time constraints on the use of the magnet.We also analysed the short-term, medium-term and long-term experiments separately, in order to identify the differentially-expressed genes induced by the magnetic field. An opposite trend has been observed in mechanical simulators, RPM vs. centrifuge."

Although we observed a few flies levitating freely, the majority remained in contact with the walls, floor and ceiling of the arena enclosed within the tube. The net effective weight of an individual fly on the walls, floor or ceiling depends on its position within the arena (Figure 1C). The effective weight is less than 5% of its weight outside the magnet throughout the arena. We observed that the levitation position of the freely levitating flies varied with their hydration. Dehydrated (dead) flies levitated a few millimetres lower in the magnet than living flies. There was a 1-2 mm difference in levitation position between each of the Drosophila stages. This is consistent with the greater water content of the embryos and early larvae (more than 80% of total mass), reaching the lower level at late pupae (less than 70% of total mass) in comparison with an average 75% of water content in adults [36,37].\nb) delay of development due to the magnetic field: The results of the ""long-term"" (22-day) experiments demonstrated that 1-12 hour old embryos can develop fully, progressing from larvae to pupae to imagoes, both in the RPM and in a strong magnetic field up to 16.5 T. Development in the magnet (0 g*, 1 g* and 2 g*) was slightly but reproducibly delayed by one day, compared to the 1 g control outside the magnet, suggesting that metamorphosis can be delayed in one or more developmental checkpoints. A less evident delay in development was observed in the RPM. Table 2 shows the number of flies that developed from eggs laid in the magnetic field in a ""short term"" (1-day) experiment. After the females were mated, 25 males and 25 females were selected randomly and placed together in the same container in the magnet for 26 hours at 14°C. The eggs laid during those 26 hours were incubated outside the magnet and the flies that developed from the eggs were counted. The results show that exposure to the strong magnetic field during oogenesis and laying caused a large reduction in the number of adult flies that developed from the eggs. The number of flies that developed from eggs laid in the 16.5 T magnetic field (1 g* tube) was just 31% of the number that developed from eggs laid in the 1 g control tube outside the magnet. In the 0 g* and 2 g* tubes, where there was a significant field gradient, the reduction in the number of flies was even greater, being only 5-6% of the number resulting from the 1 g control.\nc) magnetic field affects gene expression: Using Affymetrix whole genome microarrays (Drosophila version 2.0 with 18952 probesets and GeneSpring GX), we analysed the gene expression profile of Drosophila exposed to the magnetic field, and compared the results with Drosophila in a temperature-controlled incubator placed well away from the magnet (1 g). We also compared the results of ""short-term"", ""mediumterm"" and ""long-term"" experiments. In most experiments we performed three replicates, except in a small number of cases (identified by dashes in Table 1) where we were unable to obtain one or more replicates owing to random contamination of the extractions, or time constraints on the use of the magnet.We also analysed the short-term, medium-term and long-term experiments separately, in order to identify the differentially-expressed genes induced by the magnetic field. An opposite trend has been observed in mechanical simulators, RPM vs. centrifuge."

22347458,device,"Modeled microgravity (MMG), miRNA Microarray kit","radioresponsive mirnas in modeled microgravity (mmg): To check whether the expression of radio-responsive miRNAs was altered under modeled microgravity condition, we characterized the miRNA profile of PBL irradiated with 0.2 and 2Gy and incubated in MMG. After 4 h of incubation in MMG we identified 16 miRNAs responsive to 0.2Gy (vs. 26 in 1 g) and 22 miRNAs responsive to 2Gy (vs. 20 in 1 g). After 24 h of incubation in MMG we identified only 4 miRNAs responsive to 0.2Gy (vs. 17 in 1 g) and 32 miRNAs responsive to 2Gy (vs. 52 in 1 g) (Figure 3 and Table S2). To predict the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs we first performed a computational analyses using PITA algorithm available on line [46,59]. However, all available softwares for target prediction are characterized by a large fraction of false positive, thus, the integration of target predictions with miRNA and gene target expression profiles has been proposed to refine functional miRNA-mRNA relationships. For this purpose, we defined the gene expression signature on the same PBL samples used to assess miRNA expression profile, and then we compared miRNA and mRNA expression levels (Figure 5). Gene expression profiles were carried out only in 2Gy PBL incubated for 24 h in 1 g or in MMG, since for this dose and this time point, several IRresponsive genes involved in DDR pathway were previously identified in human quiescent PBL [66] and in human peripheral blood [67]. MiRNA expression profiles were carried out in irradiated (0.2, 2Gy) vs. non-irradiated PBL, incubated for 4 and 24 h in 1 g and MMG.

This study was also approved by the Committee on Animal Care and Use at Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University (No. 22-071). The spaceflight experiments were carried out using male C57BL/10J mice (8 weeks old at launch). Wild type and pleiotrophin transgenic mice (n = 3 each) were individually housed in mouse drawer system (MDS, 11.669.868.4 cm), which is a payload developed by Alenia-Space [23]. Pleiotrophin transgenic mice were utilized to investigate the possibility of this osteogenic factor for protection of osteoporosis [24]. Food and water were supplied ad libitum.

Only 1 wild type and 2 transgenic mice returned to the Earth alive after 91 days of flight. Whole brain and adrenal glands were sampled from each mouse sacrificed by inhalation of carbon dioxide at the Life Science Support Facility of Kennedy Space Center within 3 hours after landing. After the spaceflight experiment, on-ground experiment was also carried out at the Vivarium of the Advanced Biotechnology Center in Genova, Italy. One group of mice with the same species, sex, and age were housed in MDS for 3 months as the ground controls (GCs). Another group of mice were housed in normal vivarium cage as the laboratory controls (LCs).

Moreover, their ease of husbandry, high fecundity, and small size paves the way for a possible future space experiment, triggering the proposal of their use for the study of gravitational biology [83][84][85][86][87][88][89]. We decided to explore the effects of increased gravity (hyper-g) on zebrafish larvae using the large diameter centrifuge (LDC).

Experiment 1-fractionated low LET gamma radiation and high dietary iron in rats. The aim of Experiment 1 was to characterize the impacts of fractionated doses of low LET radiation exposure and high dietary iron on fecal bacterial populations and colon homeostasis. Thirty two, 12-week-old, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were acclimated to an adequate iron diet (45 mg iron (ferric citrate)/kg diet) for 3 weeks (AIN-93G; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and then assigned to one of four groups"
26083373,cell type,intestinal microbiota,"Very little research has been done to understand the effect of low dose ionizing radiation (<1 Gy) and microgravity on the colon luminal environment and intestinal epithelium function. Large radiation doses (>8 Gy) can cause detrimental effects such as direct mucosal toxicity, delayed gastric emptying and secretion, and villous shortening [7,12]. Some data suggests that radiation exposure can affect the intestinal microbiota, and the presence and composition of these commensal bacterial groups has an effect on radiation induced-lethality [13][14][15]. Furthermore, we have reported that consumption of a diet with elevated dietary iron, by itself and in combination with low LET radiation, can alter the concentration of fecal SCFA [16], suggesting alterations to the composition of the intestinal microbiota or a functional change in microbial metabolism. An understanding of how the aforementioned environmental insults affect the microbiota is of utmost importance, as alterations to commensal bacterial groups have been implicated in the onset and recurrence of chronic intestinal inflammation and gastrointestinal diseases [17,18]. Mitigating the effects of oxidative stress caused by a combination of radiation exposure and elevated iron status is an important area of research, as no countermeasures have been thoroughly studied. Results from this research would benefit not only astronauts, but others exposed to radiation during medical diagnostic tests, and occupational radiation exposures. To our knowledge, no study has characterized the effects of fractionated, low doses (0.5-3 Gy) of low LET ionizing radiation with a high dietary iron load, or one dose high LET ionizing radiation with simulated lunar gravity conditions on colon microbiota and mucosal homeostasis. We hypothesized that characteristics of the space environment (i.e., diet, radiation, and altered gravity) would alter the intestinal microbiota and epithelium. Therefore the aims of the independent studies summarized in this work were to characterize the effects of: 1) low LET radiation exposure and high Fe diet, 2) partial weight bearing (1/6 G) and high LET radiation exposure, and 3) short term spaceflight, on the intestinal microbiota, mucosal expression of gene targets associated with microbial signaling and epithelial repair, and measurements of colonic injury and inflammation in rodents."

First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers, oligo dT primer (Promega, Madison, WI), and Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase following manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR was performed on select genes involved in the TLR signaling cascade (i.e., TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, MyD88, NF\u03baB, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1b), short chain fatty acid transport (i.e., Slc16a1, Slc5a8), and epithelial barrier restitution (i.e., TGF\u03b2, TFF3) using Taqman Array Plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a ABI 7900 HT thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (S1 Table ). To screen for potential contamination of PCR reagents, a negative PCR control of H 2 O instead of cDNA template was used. Expression levels were normalized to 18S gene expression. 16S amplicon sequencing was performed as previously described [22]. Briefly, initial amplification of the V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rDNA was performed on total DNA isolated from fecal samples. Master mixes for these reactions used the Qiagen Hotstar Hi-Fidelity Polymerase Kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) with a forward primer composed of the Roche Titanium Fusion Primer A (5'-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG -3'), a 10 bp Multiplex Identifier (MID) sequence (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) unique to each of the samples, and the universal bacteria primer 8F (5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3') [23]. The reverse primer was composed of the Roche Titanium Primer B (5'-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAG -3'), the identical 10 bp MID sequence as the forward primer and the reverse bacteria primer 338R (5'-GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3') [24] which span the V1-V2 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rDNA [24]. The thermal profile for the amplification of each sample had an initial denaturing step at 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by a cycling of denaturing of 94\u00b0C for 45 seconds, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 30 seconds and a 90 second extension at 72\u00b0C (35 cycles), a 10 minute extension at 72\u00b0C and a final hold at 4\u00b0C. Each sample was individually gel purified using the E-Gel Electrophoresis System (Life Technologies, Invitrogen). To ensure equal representation of each sample in the sequencing run, each barcoded sample was standardized by calculating equimolar amounts prior to pooling.

26295583,device,"Microarray, HARV (High Aspect Ratio Vessel), rotating cell culture system (RCSS)","Microgravity on space flights has been shown to affect the physiology of a cell considerably [1]. Normal gravity (1 g) affects 2-Dimensional culture by depositing cells on the surface of the tissue culture plate (TCP) where anchorage-dependent cells adhere and proliferate as a monolayer with very limited cell-cell interactions. The weightlessness and reduced acceleration (less than 1 g) in space, removes the effect of gravity, allowing cell cultures in space to have unhindered movement of the culture medium, a shear free environment and, as cells are not bound by any directional force, unrestricted movement of cells within the medium. Under such conditions cells tend to coalesce and form aggregates creating three dimensional (3D) environments where they interact on multiple planes [2]. The effect of reduced gravity is not restricted to changes in culture conditions as the unique environment can produce changes in the fundamental physiology of the cell. While the mechanism of action of how gravity, or the lack of it, affects molecular and cellular functions is still unclear, it has been established that microgravity or zero gravity affects vital processes of the cell and importantly, microgravity has been shown to alter cancer growth and progression [3][4][5]. However, different cancers respond differently to microgravity by losing or enhancing cellular processes and functions. In this study we cultured cell lines representative of solid and hematological tumors-DLD-1, MOLT-4 and HL-60 in a rotating cell culture system (RCCS) that simulated microgravity. The RCCS is a mechanical system that simulates reduced gravity on earth by canceling the directional vector through constant rotation of a High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV). This maintains cells in a constant free fall and a shear free environment allowing cells to coalesce and form 3D aggregates [2]. These aggregates are maintained in free fall and experience conditions of reduced gravity for the remainder of the culture period. We hypothesized that physiological changes to the cell functions such as cell proliferation and viability could be corroborated with changes in fundamental processes of the cell such as gene expression. To relate physiological changes such as an altered cell cycle profile with dysregulation of gene expression, real time PCR analysis for cell cycle genes, oncogenes and cancer development and progression markers was carried out. Genome wide expression profiling by DNA microarray of these cell lines cultured under microgravity revealed the dysregulation of several pathways in cancer and importantly, corroborated with observed physiological changes to the cell.
